// primitive data types

// String - must be in quotes or backticks
// Number - integers as well as floats(javascript沒有區分)
// Boolean - Logical entity / true or false
// Null - Intentional absence of any object value
// Undefined - A Variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
// Symbol = Built-in object whose counstructor returns a unique symbol
// BigInt - Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle

// reference data types (Objects)

// Objects are a non-primitive value and when assigned to
// a variable or passed as an argument, they are passed by reference

// Object literals, arrays and functions are all reference types

// Static Typing vs Dynamic Types

// Javascript is a dynamically typed language. This means, we do not explicitly
// define the types for our variables. C, C++, Java are statically typed.

// TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, which allows static-typing.
// This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors.
// TypeScript may be somthing you want to look into later on.

console.log('hello');
