# JavaScript Sandbox

This is all of the code from my Modern JS From The Beginning course. It contains all of the learning modules and project code.

The `Shopping List`, `Flixx`, `Tracalorie`, `Tracalorie-webpack`, and `Random Ideas` projects have the final code in a zip file in that section. There are also incremental folders for each video.

## The Starter Files

There is a folder called "javascript-sandbox-start", which contains the starter files for the learning modules. You can use these to follow along with the course or create your own files as you go. The main projects are NOT included in the starter files. They are included in the course files within those sections as well as in their own repos.

## Premium Docs

The premium markdown files with all code samples and explanation are included with the premium course at [https://traversymedia.com](https://traversymedia.com/)
